// This is just a placeholder to ensure the folder exists, usually server actions are imported directly. 
// Note: In layout I used `action="/auth/logout"` which implies a route handler. 
// But I should use `import { logout } from "@/lib/actions/auth"` and bind it to a form or button.
// For the layout sidebar, I'll fix the logout form to use the action directly in a client component or server form.
// Since layout.tsx is a server component, I can pass the action to a form. 
// I will verify the layout code I wrote in Step 233. 
// Code: <form action="/auth/logout" method="POST"> 
// This is incorrect if there is no route handler. I should update layout.tsx to use the imported action.
